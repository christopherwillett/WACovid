This is a basic exploration of infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Washington state due to covid-19. 
It uses data from the Washington State Department of Health, and utilizes R for the wrangling and visualization. 
Rmarkdown was used to create an html and docx report with some analysis and graphs.
This was also an excuse to get started with git and githib.
